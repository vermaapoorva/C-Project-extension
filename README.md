SETUP:

This project will be using SDL2, which is a cross platform graphics api.
The code should work on both windows and linux, but we should probably
stick to linux just to be safe.

1. Run "make dependencies" in extensions/src
2. Running "make" in extensions/src will produce a pong executable

Required files (too large to be stored on git):
