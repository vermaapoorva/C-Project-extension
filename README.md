# **Pong Game**
This is a game we produced using C and the SDL2 Library. We completed it as the extension to our C Project at the end of first year Computing at Imperial.

### Setup

This project will be using SDL2, which is a cross platform graphics api. 
The code should work on both windows and linux, but we should probably stick to linux just to be safe.

    1.  Run "make dependencies" in extensions/src
    2.  Running "make" in extensions/src will produce a pong executable
